RunMatrix1 has the single value of the number of "cases" (experimental combinations) to be evaluate
RunMatrix2 has all other input variables
# of samples  Meas. of Cen. Tendency  Replications  Sample Size    Skew    Excess Kurtosis  Var1  Var2  Mean1  Mean2
  1	                1	                  1000	          30	          0	          0      	    2	    2	    0	    0

where:
# of Samples = 1 (for a 2-Sample study); 0 (for a 1-Sample study)
Measure of Central Tendency = 1 for arithmetic mean; 2 for harmonic mean; 3 for median
